//A 5 question quiz that asks the user for input one after the other.  The answers of the user
//are stored within this source file (the program), and compared with the user's answer to each
//question.
//User is given the results of their answers after each question, and then perhaps a tally is made at the end.
//From this video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9j5KkOC_goQ

//The question is a struct, with two members - text of the question and array of the multiple choice
//answers.
//Answer is a struct too with an indication of if its correct or incorrect.
//There are 5 questions, and each question should increment a for loop after the user gives an answer
//in order to bring up the next question.
//You could upgrade the app with multiple users, money prizes, levels, etc.

1. separate function to read user answer, perhaps the answer() function,
2. which will store and compare the user answer as well,
3. then mark correctflag true or false and output correct or wrong
NOTE: probably no need for answer_check it might be able to just store user input
and compare it within the struct or the function.  You should preserve answer as a struct.
The function will gather user input.  The answer should be stored in the struct.
